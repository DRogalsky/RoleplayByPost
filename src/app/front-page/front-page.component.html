<p class='intro-p'>
    Roleplay by Post is for people who want to pen and paper game but don't have the time for regular sessions. After
    joining a game you can post what you do to the log and then go about your day. Your GM or Game Master will log on
    when they can and post a response to what happened. A way to play that fits around any schedule.
